/* *
 * Reentrant Lock:
 *
 * synchronized was introduced long back in Java. Then Java 5 introduced Reentrant Lock.
 * This is exactly like synchronized and it offers some additional flexibility.
 * Reentrant Lock = Synchronized + Flexibility.
 * Fairness Policy: With Reentrant Lock, we can enable fairness policy. The policy states that a thread which has been waiting longer will get the chance to acquire the lock.
 * tryLock with Timeout: With Reentrant Lock, we can also enable tryLock with Timeout which states that the maximum time for a thread to wait to acquire the lock.
