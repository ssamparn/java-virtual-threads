 * Stack Size: Platform threads have a fixed stack memory size (1MB / 2MB) to store the local variables, method and method call information etc.
 * Even though we can adjust the stack memory size, that size has to be allocated upfront.
 * Once the thread is created, we can not modify the size. In that case, platform threads have a fixed stack memory size.
 * But virtual threads on the other hand, don't have a fixed stack memory size. They have a flexible / resizable stack.
 * It's called stack chuck object.
