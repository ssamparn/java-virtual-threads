     * Virtual threads are simply an illusion provided by Java.
     * Even though it looks like a thread & accepts a runnable & we can do all the thread operations like thread.start() or thread.join(),
     * but OS can not see them or schedule them, then how does it work or gets scheduled?
     * Imagine virtual threads as objects. e.g: Person person = new Person("sam");
     * We should be able to create a million these Person objects in a loop & and store them anywhere,
     * similarly, virtual threads are not platform threads. Nothing is created at the OS level.
     * They are like this tiny objects that gets created in the "Heap" region which is controlled by the JVM process as they are considered as objects.
     * So we should just stop visualizing them as threads and start seeing them as tasks, which accepts a runnable.
     * Whenever, we do a Thread.ofVirtual().start(() -> someTask()); what actually happens is,
     * all the virtual threads gets added to an internal queue, and this queue is governed by Fork-Join Pool.
     * The number of threads in the fork-join pool depends on the number of core processor we have in the machine.
     * Number of cores = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
     * So the task which is executed by the virtual threads is actually executed by a platform thread (managed by fork-join pool).
     * Now the question is, in case of blocking operations (Thread.sleep() or a blocking I/O) why millions of virtual threads are not blocked?
     * This is where JAVA has done the magic.
     * Whenever a virtual thread (mounted on a platform thread) sees a blocking operation, it parks the task. It unloads itself. This is called Parking. After unloading, it loads itself with a new task, called Unparking.
     * So virtual threads gets mounted and unmounted on platform threads continuously, and tasks gets parked & unparked continuously by virtual threads. That's the reason virtual threads never gets blocked.
