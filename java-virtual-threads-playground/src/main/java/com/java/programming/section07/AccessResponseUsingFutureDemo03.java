/* *
 * CONCURRENCY Vs. PARALLELISM:
 *
 * Concurrency and Parallelism are not two competing things.
 * Concurrency is a broder concept. Parallelism is a specific concept within Concurrency.
 * Concurrency:
 *      Concurrency is about dealing with multiple tasks over a period of time, while performing only one task at any given time. e.g: Launching both Chrome and Firefox at the same time.
 *      Even though launched simultaneously, CPU engages with one browser at a time but giving an illusion that both browsers are running at the same time.
 *      e.g: One chef prepares multiple foods.
 *
 * Parallelism:
 *      Breaking a large task into multiple smaller tasks, where each small task can be processed independently to achieve significant performance improvement.
 *      e.g: Sort an array with 6 million elements. Divide the task into 6 threads and each thread processes 1 million elements.
 *      e.g: 6 chefs prepares 6 foods.
