    /**
     * Notes about ExecutorCompletionService:
     * ExecutorCompletionService is a utility that helps you submit a bunch of Callable tasks to an Executor and then retrieve their results as they complete, rather than in the order they were submitted.
     * It essentially combines:
     *   - an Executor (e.g., a thread pool) that runs your tasks, and
     *   - a completion queue (BlockingQueue<Future<V>>) where task results are placed, as and when the tasks are completed.
     * This pattern is great when task durations vary, and you want to process fast results immediately without waiting for slow ones.
     * */
